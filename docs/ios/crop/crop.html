<h2>Crop</h2>

<p>The project's "average" image is used in specifying a crop of the images from which to generate the video. The "average" image is made by aligning the images to the project's target image and then merging the aligned images into a single image. Following the alignment, it is very unlikely that all the image boarders will be aligned. In fact the (virtual) stack of images will probably resemble a very untidy stack of cards. In such cases the user specified crop may partially lie outside some image boarders. (Generally, the wider/larger the crop, the greater the number of images that will not fully cover the crop.)</p>
<p>Using the project from "Your first project" the following show the results of specifying crops of different sizes. The blue rectangle is the crop. The white rectangles are the image boarders of the four images. The green rectangle, only visible in the fourth image, is the target image. The rectangles are shown by tapping the top right square icon. This icon also shows the number of images that are not fully covered by the crop.</p>
<img style="margin:20px 20px;border:2px solid black;width:25%" src="../imgs/crop.jpg" alt="Crop">
<img style="margin:20px 20px;border:2px solid black;width:25%" src="../imgs/crop1outside.jpg" alt="Crop 1 outside">
<img style="margin:20px 20px;border:2px solid black;width:25%" src="../imgs/crop2outside.jpg" alt="Crop 2 outside">
<img style="margin:20px 20px;border:2px solid black;width:25%" src="../imgs/crop3outside.jpg" alt="Crop 3 outside">
<p>
When an image does not fully cover the crop area, the resulting video will show some "background". The exposed background may be so small that it is deemed to be not too distracting and hence can be ignored. However, it is always best to try to get the crop to be placed so that it both displays the area of the images required without exposing too much background. Where the display of the background can't be avoided, the user can choose (via Settings) a colour of the background that minimizes the distraction e.g. a green background for a pastoral scene. The default grey background is a reasonable starting point.
</p>
<p> The following images are two frames of generated videos from this project. The first where the crop has been selected to not expose any background, and the other where a signisficant amount of background is visible.</p>
