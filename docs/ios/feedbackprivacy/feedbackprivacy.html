<h2>Feedback / Bug Reports</h2>
<p>Please send email to <a href="mailto:cyferltd@gmail.com?subject=Zoetic" style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">cyferltd@gmail.com</a> rather than through the App Store&rsquo;s review section. We have no way to help you or contact you through reviews.</p>

<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>No personal information is processed or collected. In fact, no information whatsoever leaves your device apart from what is automatically undertaken by iOS settings such as uploading photos and videos to iCloud. All processing of the images is undertaken on your device.</p>
<p>If you send logs to Zoetic&rsquo;s author (to help with fault finding) then a small amount of information about your device (model, iOS version etc) is included in the logs, in addition to the process flow that Zoetic took up to the point you submit the logs. Zoetic&rsquo;s settings file and current project&rsquo;s settings file are also included in the submission. Paths and project names are likely to be included in the files so you should ensure that when submitting a log you do not use project names or paths that contain personal, or any other form of sensitive, information. You may wish to check what is being submitted by, for example, emailing the logs to yourself before emailing them to Zoetic's author.</p>
