<h2> Further Discussion</h2>

<ul class="inline">
<li>The most important step in creating a good result is deciding on the two alignment points. The first point is the actual alignment location and is the area that will be most &ldquo;in focus&rdquo; in the resulting video. The second point is used to calculate the scaling, translation and rotation factors, relative to the first point, required to align the images.</li>
<li>Try to use alignment points that are as far apart as possible. This will, generally, result in more stable videos.</li>
<li>The series is aligned to the first image (i.e. the target) in the series. (The Pro version allows any image to be selected as the target image.) The target image should be a good example of the series; at the orientation and scale required of the video to be generated.</li>
<li>It is not necessary to mark all the images before a video is created though only the marked images will be used.</li>
<li>Additional images can be added to a project at any time.</li>
<li>As well as using external apps to import images into Zoetic, images can be imported directly into a project using Zoetic&rsquo;s <em>Add images</em> function. However, you are likely to find greater flexibility using external apps. Therefore, it is  advisable to share from apps to Zoetic, rather than Zoetic &ldquo;pulling&rdquo; images from apps.</li>
<li>(Pro only) Images can also be added to the project by taking new photographs. From Zoetic's menu, choose <em>Take Photos</em>, and the camera will be activated with the current project's target image overlayed on the camera's view. A slider allows the transparency of the overlay to be varied. The overlay helps to ensure the new photo captures the required scene. Note that the scale and orientation don't matter (zooming is not necessary) since Zoetic's alignment process will handle those parameters. Once one or more photos have been taken, they can be viewed and/or deleted prior to being added to the project by clicking on the small preview rectangle.</li>
<li>Images can be sorted by date (for images with dates) or by the order they were added to the project. Sorting by date will result in undated images ending up at the start (ascending order) or end (descending order) of the project. The <em>Sort</em> function can add dates to any undated images. Alternatively, images can be manually moved to the desired locations. </li>
<li>(Pro only) In the <em>Sort</em> function images may be temporarily selected or deselected for processing. This allows for experimentation without permanently deleting images from a project.</li>
