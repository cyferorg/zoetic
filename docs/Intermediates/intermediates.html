<h2>Generating the videos</h2>

<p>The videos produced by Zoetic are created from a series of images chosen by the user and a series of intermediate images automatically generated from those user images. The intermediate images are created by combining consecutive user images so as to produce a smooth (or as specified by the user) transition from one image to the next. The number of intermediates images between each consecutive pair of user images can be specified in three different ways.</p>
<ol class="inline">
<li>A single constant number. This will produce a video which transitions between the user images at a constant rate. The user specifies this constant.</li>
<li>A number that is relevant to the user image dates. This will produce a video which transitions depending on the date of the images. A pair of images with dates one day apart will transition seven times faster than a pair of images with dates one week apart. The resulting video will give an impression of the user images placement with regards to time. The user specifies a number for the intermediates but this will be taken to be the average number of intermediates between consecutive images.</li>
<li>A number that is calculated so that the transitions are synchronised with an audio (music) track. The user does not specify a number but instead specifies the music track and various parameters to identify the synchronising musical beats.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as the above intermediate setting, the user also specifies a value for the frames per second (FPS) that the video will use. For the first two above intermediate approaches, the FPS will change the speed of the video. For example, a pair of images with 30 intermediate images between them will take 3 seconds to transition if the FPS is set at 10, whereas it will take just 1 second if the FPS is set at 30. With teh music synchronising approach the FPS will not change the speed of the video (since it has to stay synchronised with the audio track) but will alter the smoothness of the playback.</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>Intermediate images are created by combining a weighted first image with a weighted second image. If the weighting for the first image has a value of 0.3, and the weighting for the second a value of 0.7, the transitioned image would be an image formed by combining 30% of the first and 70% of the second. At the start of the transition the first image has a weight of 1 and the second image a weight of 0. At the end of the transition the first image has a weight of 0 and the second image a weight of. The weighting are calculated using a filter which can be one of the following:</p>
<ol class="inline">
<li>Equal - the transition between consecutive images takes place at a constant rate.</li>
<li>Original - the transition slowly moves away from the first image, increasing speed until it is half way between the images and then slows down as it approaches the second image. This produces intermediate images consisting of images that are closer to the original images.</li>
<li>Original skew - the transition quickly moves from the first image towards the second image, and then slows down as it approaches the second image. This produces a more abrupt transition compared to the above two filters but is useful for videos that need to emphasise the start of the transition, specifically, when synchronising with music.</li>
<li>Immediate - the transition immediately moves from the first image to the second image. This produces an even more abrupt transition than the above filter and, like that filter, is useful for videos that need to emphasise the start of the transition.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Music synchronisation</h3>
<p>From Zoetic's main menu choose <em>Music sync</em>. Tap the music icon at the bottom right of the screen and choose the required audio file. Tap the play button and then adjust the four sliders as described below. If your device struggles with showing the graph and/or the images, one or both of those visualisations can be turned-off by trapping the corresponding 'power' button.</p>
<ul class="inline">
<li>Peak - A beat is detected if it is greater than this percentage of the previous maximum amplitude.</li>
<li>Noise - Any amplitude below this value is ignored. The noise level is shown on the graph by two grey lines.</li>
<li>Frequency - The maximum number of beats that are allowed per second.</li>
<li>Max fall - The previous maximum value is decreased by a factor based on this value. (The lower the value, the faster the fall.) A value of 100 results in the previous maximum not being decreased which means for a new beat to be detected there must be an amplitude greater than the previous beat by the <em>Peak</em> percentage. The current maximum is shown on the graph by two red lines. Note that for higher values of <em>Max fall</em> the red lines can be seen to move slowly inwards. For lower values, the red lines follows the amplitude signals very closely.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
</pre>
<p>The up and down buttons to the right of the graph just scale the graph for visual inspection. They do not change the beats that are detected.</p>
<p>Once the beats are being detected as required, stop the play back and then play through the entire audio track to record the beats that will be used by Zoetic in generating the video. Return to the main menu and tap <em>Make video</em>. A video showing these steps can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk7T0Q4M0n8" style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">here</a>.</p>
