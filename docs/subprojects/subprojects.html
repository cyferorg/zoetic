<p>These are four images from the Flats Construction project.</p>
<img style="margin:20px 20px;border:2px solid black" border="2" hspace="20" vspace="20" src="ex1.jpg" alt="Example1" width="500" height="375">
<img style="margin:20px 20px;border:2px solid black" border="2" hspace="20" vspace="20" src="ex2.jpg" alt="Example2" width="500" height="375">

<p>
As you will see, it is very difficult to identify two alignment points that are locatable in all four images. In such a situation, different approaches might be taken.
<li>Use a subset of the images where two alignment points can be identified. If lucky, this may be acceptable.</li>
<li>Estimate the location of alignment points. This is very unlikely to produce good results.</li>
<li>Use Zoetic's sub-project capability.</li>
<p>The following describes the last option.</p>
<p>Examine the set of images that make up the project and split them into sub-sets of images, with each sub-set containing images where alignment points can be identified. One constraint when forming these sub-sets is that the last image of a sub-set must be the same image as the first image in the following sub-set, and that image must be markable by the alignment points that are used in both sub-sets.</p>
<p>Each sub-set is handled by Zoetic as a project. The Flats Construction project was split into three projects covering (1) original garden; (2) ground clearing; (3) construction of the flats. The alignment points used in the three projects were:</p>
<img style="margin:20px 20px;border:2px solid black" border="2" hspace="20" vspace="20" src="subset1.jpg" alt="Subset1" width="400" height="206">
<img style="margin:20px 20px;border:2px solid black" border="2" hspace="20" vspace="20" src="subset2.jpg" alt="Subset2" width="400" height="206">
<img style="margin:20px 20px;border:2px solid black" border="2" hspace="20" vspace="20" src="subset3.jpg" alt="Subset3" width="400" height="206">
<p>For Zoetic to recognise a project as a sub-project, the project must be named using a numerical sequence e.g. flat1, flat2, flat3 and Zoetic's Process Sub-projects function should be enabled within Settings. Then, when the first project is loaded (flat1 in the previous example), Zoetic will process the additional sub-projects as being part of the explicitly loaded project (flat1).</p>
<p>It should be noted:</p>
<li>The first sub-project's target image will be used as the target for the entire project i.e. all the images in the subsequent sub-projects will be aligned with the first sub-project's target image.</li>
<li>The Sort function only operates on the explicitly loaded project. To re-order, delete, add (etc) images to a sub-project, that sub-project must be explicitly loaded into Zoetic.</li>
<p> The first and last images of each of the three sub-projects making up the Flats Construction project. Note that the last image is the same as the following sub-project's first image, and that the alignment points presented above are identifiable in the corresponding last and first images.
