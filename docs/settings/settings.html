<h3>Video creation</h3>

<table style="width:100%">

<h3>Images</h3>
<tr>
<td>Order by date</td>
<td>Use images' dates rather than the order the images were added to the project for sorting. The sort is implemented by tapping the sort buttons in the Sort screen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Draw image borders</td>
<td>Draw borders around images in the composite image. This has no effect on the generated videos but showing borders may help in defining the crop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maximum input image resolution</td>
<td>Images with greater height or width will be sampled to the specified value. Allowing the use of large images may create out of memory problems. <b>(Only Pro and Simple Mode off)</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warn when image resolution is reduced</td>
<td>A warning will be displayed when images imported into a project have been reduced in size. The warning will only be displayed if the reduction took place due to the above user specified resolution limitation or, if using the non-Pro version of Zoetic, when the hard resolution limit is exceeded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
</table>
<table style="width:100%">
<h3>Marking</h3>
<td>Hide face/eye detect function</td>
<td>All face/eye detection takes place on the user's device (i.e. images are not sent across any network) but to address any concern that Google (or any other organisation) may process images the function can be hidden and hence not accidentally activated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Remember view between images</td>
<td>Maintain the marking view's zoom and position between images.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pre-aligned mode</td>
<td>Assume all images are already aligned and hence don't need marking.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table style="width:100%">
<h3>Camera</h3>
<tr>
<td>Camera resolution</td>
<td>The resolution to use when using Zoetic's camera function. <b>(Pro only)</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Backup photos</td>
<td>Copy photos taken by the camera to the DCIM/Camera folder. This allows for other apps to use the photos. <b>(Pro only)</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<table style="width:100%">
<h3>Misc</h3>
<tr>
<td>Simple Mode</td>
<td>Hide the more advanced features of Zoetic Pro. Switching between on and off will reset some of the current project's settings. <b>(Pro only)</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Process sub-projects</td>
<td>Treat projects with numerically consecutive names as sub-projects of the first project in the sequence. Please see the Sub-projects section of Zoetic's help for more information. <b>(Pro only and Simple Mode off)</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tap to share log</td>
<td>Use to share Zoetic logs with Zoetic's author (for debugging) or anyone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tap to set default values</td>
<td>Reset to default values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tap to reset all warning and guidance messages</td>
<td>Revert to the state when Zoetic was first installed.</td>
</tr>
